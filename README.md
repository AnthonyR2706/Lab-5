# Lab-5
Will take the song data from 5 weeks of spotify csv charts and turn them into a binary search tree. The subset method can be used to find all the songs that fit between two songs alphabetically. Each Song node will also contain the name of the artist, the average amount of plays that song had, and the average amount of plays the artist had.
