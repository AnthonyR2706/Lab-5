# Lab-5
Will take the song data from 5 weeks of spotify csv charts and turn them into a binary search tree. The subset method can be sued to find all the songs that fit between two songs alphabetically. Each Song node will also contain teh name of the artist, teh average amount of plays that song had, and teh average amount of plays the artist had.
